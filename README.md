# THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER UNDER DEVELOPMENT
This fork holds the code that supported the 2017 Project Sidewalk deployment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. This code has been abandoned in favor of a different method of incorporating work from MTurk in the main [SidewalkWebpage repository](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage). But we are keeping this version open and available here. We no longer support it, nor recommend it's use.
